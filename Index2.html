           <h2><u><b>Dr. Sanduk Ruit</b></u></h2>
           <p>Sanduk Ruit (born September 4, 1954) is an Ophthalmologist (eye surgeon) from Nepal who has restored the sight of 
		   over 180,000 people across Africa and Asia using small-incision cataract Surgery. Ruit is the founder and the executive
		   director of the Tilganga institute of Ophthalmology, which manufactures high-quality intraocular lenses for surgery at a
		   fraction of the price of the previous manufacturing cost. The low cost has made cataract surgeries affordable to the world's 
		   poorest people. Ruit has been referred to as the "God of Sight".He was awarded the   Ramon Magsaysay Ward for Peace and International 
		   Understanding, considered to be the Asian equivalent of the Nobel Prize, for "placing Nepal at the forefront of developing safe, 
		   effective, and economical procedures for cataract surgery, enabling the needlessly blind in even the poorest countries to see again.<br> <br>
		   
		   The nearest school from his village was fifteen days' walk away in Darjeeling. His father, a small-time businessman, sent Ruit to St Robert's
		   School in Darjeeling at the age of seven, and provided financial support for his early medical career. Ruit's life in Darjeeling was hard as he was
		   away from his parents and home for about four-five years. After a few years he returned to Nepal and continued his study. In 1969, Ruit graduated
		   from Siddhartha Vanasthali School in Kathmandu, Nepal,[9] and later was further educated in India. He studied a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of 
		   Surgery from King George's Medical College, Lucknow with scholarship from 1972 to 1976. Ruit then returned to Nepal and worked as a General Physician
		   in Bir Hospital, Kathmandu for three years. Later he wanted to specialize in ophthalmology, so he continued his studies from 1981 at the All India
		   Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi with a scholarship and achieved his Master's Degree. After three years in 1984 he returned to Nepal and 
		   worked in an eye hospital in Tripureshwor for eight years. Meanwhile Australian ophthalmologist Fred Hollows was in Nepal as a mentor, selected by WHO.
		   He noticed Ruit's work and determination and offered him further study about cataract surgery in Australia in 1986. Ruit further studied in Australia,
		   Netherlands and the United States.He has received numerous awards and recognition for his work in making cataract surgery affordable and accessible to 
		   people in developing countries.
